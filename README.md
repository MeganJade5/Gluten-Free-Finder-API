## Project Management
The project managment tool we've used to track our progress for this assesment is [Trello, which can be viewed here.](https://trello.com/b/g94algv7/t3a2-full-stack-app) We have 10 columns in our board, each of which contribute to an agile approach of product development.

1. **Blocked** Tasks which we are unable to continue with without further follow up. 
2. **Extras** Our nice-to-haves if time allows. 
3. **Need to discuss** Tasks which require more discussion.
4. **Coming Up** Tasks we will complete next sprint but need to look into before the sprint begins.
5. **To-do** Current sprint tasks.
6. **In progress** Tasks being worked on.
7. **Testing** Any tasks going through manual/user testing before being completed. 
8. **Done** Finished tasks!
9. **Questions** Similar to our discuss column however we added this board to help us visually.
10. **Resources** Any resources we want to keep during our development process. For quick reference.
